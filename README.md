Multi-label Node Classification
A Pytorch Implementation of the Paper "Multi-label Node Classification On Graph-structured Data".

All the datasets used in our paper are in the folder "data/"

The proposed multi-label graph generator model can be found in folder "Graph Generator Model/"

The metric/ folder saves the implementation of all the four metrics use in our paper, including: AP, F1-micro, F1-macro, AUROC

And the implementation of all the baselines are in folder "models/"
